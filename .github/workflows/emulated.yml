# Emulation is incredibly slow and memory demanding. It seems that any
# executable with GHC RTS takes at least 7-8 Gb of RAM, so we can run
# `cabal` or `ghc` on their own, but cannot run them both at the same time,
# striking out `cabal test`. Instead we rely on system packages and invoke
# `ghc --make` manually, and even so `ghc -O` is prohibitively expensive.
