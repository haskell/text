-- Efficient locale-sensitive support for text I\/O.
--
-- The functions in this module obey the runtime system's locale,
-- character set encoding, and line ending conversion settings.
--
-- If you want to do I\/O using the UTF-8 encoding, use @Data.Text.IO.Utf8@,
-- which is faster than this module.
--
-- If you know in advance that you will be working with data that has
-- a specific encoding, and your application is highly
-- performance sensitive, you may find that it is faster to perform
-- I\/O with bytestrings and to encode and decode yourself than to use
-- the functions in this module.

-- | The 'readFile' function reads a file and returns the contents of
-- the file as a string.  The entire file is read strictly, as with
-- 'getContents'.
--
-- Beware that this function (similarly to 'Prelude.readFile') is locale-dependent.
-- Unexpected system locale may cause your application to read corrupted data or
-- throw runtime exceptions about "invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)"
-- or "invalid argument (invalid character)". This is also slow, because GHC
-- first converts an entire input to UTF-32, which is afterwards converted to UTF-8.
--
-- If your data is UTF-8,
-- using 'Data.Text.Encoding.decodeUtf8' '.' 'Data.ByteString.readFile'
-- is a much faster and safer alternative.

-- | Wrap readChunk and return a value indicating if we're reached the EOF.
-- This is needed because unpack_nl is unable to discern the difference
-- between a buffer with just \r due to EOF or because not enough data was left

-- | Read a single chunk of strict text from a
-- 'Handle'. The size of the chunk depends on the amount of input
-- currently buffered.
--
-- This function blocks only if there is no data available, and EOF
-- has not yet been reached. Once EOF is reached, this function
-- returns an empty string instead of throwing an exception.
--
-- == Behavior
--
-- Unlike byte-oriented functions, 'hGetChunk' operates on complete UTF-8
-- characters. Since UTF-8 characters can occupy 1 to 4 bytes, this function
-- cannot guarantee reading an exact number of bytes. Instead, it reads
-- complete characters up to the handle's internal buffer limit.
--
-- == Buffer Size
--
-- The maximum chunk size is determined by the handle's internal character
-- buffer, which is set to 2048 characters (not bytes) by the GHC runtime
-- constant @dEFAULT_CHAR_BUFFER_SIZE@. This buffer size cannot be modified
-- through any public API.
--
-- == UTF-8 Considerations
--
-- When working with UTF-8 encoded text:
--
-- * The function will never return a partial character
-- * The actual number of bytes read may vary depending on the character
--   encoding (ASCII characters = 1 byte, other Unicode characters = 2-4 bytes)

-- | Read the remaining contents of a 'Handle' as a string.  The
-- 'Handle' is closed once the contents have been read, or if an
-- exception is thrown.
--
-- Internally, this function reads a chunk at a time from the
-- lower-level buffering abstraction, and concatenates the chunks into
-- a single string once the entire file has been read.
--
-- As a result, it requires approximately twice as much memory as its
-- result to construct its result.  For files more than a half of
-- available RAM in size, this may result in memory exhaustion.

-- | Use a more efficient buffer size if we're reading in
