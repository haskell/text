# Authors

The base code for this library was originally written by Tom Harper,
based on the stream fusion framework developed by Roman Leshchinskiy,
Duncan Coutts, and Don Stewart.

The core library was fleshed out, debugged, and tested by Bryan
O'Sullivan. Transition from UTF-16 to UTF-8 is by Andrew Lelechenko.
